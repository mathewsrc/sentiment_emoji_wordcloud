"Mr. and Mrs. Vaughan have come, sir," he said.

"Send up to my apartment and tell Mrs. May we are sitting down to
dinner," returned Holland promptly, and advanced to meet the prosperous
looking couple approaching.

"I'm afraid we are late," said the lady, "but can you blame us? Have you
heard? We have been telegraphing to Hillsborough all the afternoon to
find out what has gone."

"You are not late. My sister has not come down yet. I was just reading
about your robbery. Have you lost anything of value?"

"Oh, I suppose so," said Mrs. Vaughan cheerfully, sitting down and
beginning to draw off her gloves. "We had a Van Dyke etching, and some
enamels that have gone certainly, and Charlie feels awfully about his
wine."

"Yes," said Mr. Vaughan gloomily. "I tell you he is going to have a
happy time with that champagne. It is the best I ever tasted."

"Upon my word," said Geoffrey, "they are a nice lot of countrymen up
there. Four robberies and not so much as a clue."

"_You_ need not be afraid," said Mrs. Vaughan rather spitefully. "In
spite of all your treasures, I don't believe any thief would take the
trouble to climb to the top of your mountain."
