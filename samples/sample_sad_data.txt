A heavy shower of rain brought our fond parent home, in the hope of
affording shelter to her callow brood. Our feeble voices were raised
to implore her succour, for the wet flowed in upon us, and we shivered
with the uncomfortable sensations it occasioned. Perceiving our
situation, our tender mother uttered a shrill cry of despair. She flew
round and round the cage, in the vain attempt of forcing an entrance.
She pecked the wire with her bill, and beat against it with her downy
breast. Ah! who can conceive the anguish of her little throbbing
heart, at thus finding herself robbed of her darling treasure! She
passed the whole night in mournful lamentations, nor ventured to quit
us till our piercing cries for food rung in her ears, and roused her
from the stupor of grief into which she had fallen.
